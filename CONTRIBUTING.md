# Contributing

While the Pictogrammers Icon Group offers many ways to contibute to our various icon libraries, our brand icon library is much more restrictive. We vet each request very carefully and only add icons in which we have explict permission, or the brand's license is very clear we are allowed to redistribute.

That being said, you can still help!

## Requesting New Brands

- Open a [New Issue](https://github.com/Pictogrammers/brand-icons/issues) to request a new brand.
- Do some research on your brand and locate as many resources as you can find that provides to us:
  - Official logos, monograms, or icons.
  - License, declarations, copyrights, etc.
- Include as much information as possible in your requests. It saves us time!

Thank you for your interest in making our brand icon library robust!
