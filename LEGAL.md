# Legal Information

The Pictogrammers Icon Group takes other's licenses and intellectual property very seriously.

# Copyrights & Trademarks

The Pictogrammers Icon Group provides license, copyright, and trademark information on each individual icon contained in our brand icon library. It is our user's responsibility to consider each brand's legal stipulations when using an icon. As licenses are always subject to change, it is also our user's responsibility to regularly verify they are in compliance with each license. The Pictogrammers Icon Group will document any additions, removals, or changes to brands or licenses on each release in our CHANGELOG.

If you discover a brand license that has changed and does not match the information we have on file, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Pictogrammers/brand-icons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Brand+Update&template=2_brand_update.yml). We will verify and update were appropriate.

The Pictogrammers Icon Group cannot be held responsible for any use or misuse of any brand assets offered in our library by our users.

# Brand Guidelines

In addition to providing license information for each brand, we will also provide links to a brand's guidelines if they provide one. We encourage our users to read these guidelines and ensure their usage is in accordance with them. As with licenses, guidelines are subject to change, so it is important our user's regularly verify they are still in compliance.

The Pictogrammers Icon Group cannot be help responsible if our users use brand icons against the brand's defined guidelines.

# Brand Updates

In the case of outdated icons or information, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Pictogrammers/brand-icons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Brand+Update&template=2_brand_update.yml).

# Brand Removals

We take other's licenses and intellectual property very seriously. If you wish to have your brand removed from our library, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Pictogrammers/brand-icons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Brand+Removal&template=3_brand_removal.yml). Once affiliation has been established, we will remove icons within 2 weeks.
