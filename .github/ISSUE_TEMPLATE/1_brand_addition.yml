        Here are some things to consider before submitting your request:

          - We will not add non-brand icons to this library.
          - Not all brand icons can/will be added. We vet each brand icon directly with the brand owner.
            - The brand's license must explicitly allow redistribution _or_
            - We must recieve written permission from the brand owner allowing its inclusion.
