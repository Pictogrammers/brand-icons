# Brand Icons

A carefully curated library of brand icons.

## Usage

> Before using this library, please be sure to read and understand our [legal disclaimer](./LEGAL.md).

_Usage information coming soon._

## Why another brand library?

One of the biggest struggles with including brand icons in any library is licensing. Other icon libraries out there who offer brand icons mostly infer permission based on wording in a brand's license or follow the "ask for forgiveness later" mantra. We wanted to do it differently.

Every brand icon included in our library has been given permission by the brand owner or the brand's license explicitly states the asset can be redistributed. We provide all license, copyright, trademark, and branding guidelines (where available) for each and every glyph. When you use our brand library, there is no question about the license. If we cannot get permission and license information, we don't include the brand. It's that simple.

## Where can I see the licenses?

Everytime we release, we sync up all the brand licenses in our [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md) file.
